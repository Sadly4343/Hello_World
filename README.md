# Overview

This software is created to illustrate the display of Hello World! The common starting point for any programmer.

The purpose of this software is to display Hello World! to the user and doing so through the use of the python language. This is the first step many programmers take and I want to illustrate my growth from this point forward as the first program I created in my journey.
